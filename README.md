# GraphDL

Graph Description Language is a GraphQL Schema Definition Language / syntax that enables terse GraphQL Schema creation with far fewer lines of code.

> Note: this is experimental and for learning-purposes. For fullest GraphQL schema language implementation, use `buildSchema()` from the `graphql` npm library. More info: http://graphql.org/learn/schema/.

## What? Why?

GraphQL is a pretty cool piece of tech that allows application clients (browsers, native apps, etc) to query for data from a server without making multiple RESTful requests. Imagine querying a GitHub user, all her/his projects, and each of those projects contributors from the GitHub API. If I were pulling my GitHub information (username `@matthiasak`), I would make these requests:

- https://api.github.com/users/matthiasak -> grab `repos_url` and request it, too
- https://api.github.com/users/matthiasak/repos -> for each of these (potentially hundreds of items), grab each `contributors_url`
- i.e. https://api.github.com/repos/matthiasak/3D-svg-model-viewer/contributors -> grabs list of contributors

The data being requested then, by you poor programmer, must be "stitched" back together into a usable data structure after waiting potentially 30 seconds for all your data to be requested:

The architecture of all the data you requested:

```

```

For every user there's 2 requests, for each repo there's 2 requests, so for a user with 30 repos that means we're looking at 2 + 30*2 = 62 JSON requests just for this data (barring some special `&include=...` features of some RESTful APIs).

With GraphQL, we make only one request, instead, *and* we can configure exactly what fields of each record we need:

```graphql
# graphql query
query getContributorGraph($user: String) {
	user(username: $user){
		username
		repos(limit: 100){
			contributors {
				username
			}
		}
	}
}
```

The problem - ah yes, there is one dear reader - is that defining the GraphQL *server* is a bunch of boilerplate:
<details>
<summary>Unroll for awful boilerplate</summary>
```js
const Author = new GraphQLObjectType({
	name: "Author"
	, fields: () => ({
		_id: {type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString)}
		, name: {type:GraphQLString}
		, posts: {
			type: new GraphQLList(Post)
			, resolve: author =>
				PostsList.filter(p => p.author === author._id)
		}
		, numPosts: {
			type: GraphQLInt
			, resolve: author =>
				PostsList.filter(p => p.author === author._id).length
		}
	})
})

const Post = new GraphQLObjectType({
	name: "Post"
	, fields: () => ({
		_id: {type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString)}
		, title: {
			type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString)
			, resolve: post => post.title || "Does not exist"
		}
		, content: {type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString)}
		, author: {
			type: Author
			, resolve: post =>
				AuthorsList.filter(a => a._id === post.author).shift()
		}
	})
})

const mutation = new GraphQLObjectType({
	name: "Mutations"
	, fields: () => ({
		createPost: {
			type: Post
			, args: {
				title: {type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString)}
				, content: {type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString)}
			}
			, resolve: (source, {title, content}) => {
				let post = {
					_id: `${Date.now()}::${Math.ceil(Math.random() * 9999999)}`
					, title
					, content
				}
				PostsList.push(post)
				return post
			}
		}
	})
})

// This is the Root Query
const query = new GraphQLObjectType({
    name: 'BlogSchema',
    fields: () => ({
        echo: {
            type: GraphQLString
            , args: {
                message: {
                	type: GraphQLString
                }
            }
            , resolve: (source, { message }) => `Echo: ${message}`
        }
        , posts: {
        	type: new GraphQLList(Post)
        	, resolve: () => PostsList
        }
        , authors: {
        	type: new GraphQLList(Author)
        	, resolve: () => AuthorsList
        }
    })
})

// The Schema
const Schema = new GraphQLSchema({ query, mutation })

export default Schema
```

<summary>Instead of doing that, I tried my hand at creating a language to specify all that mess:</summary>
